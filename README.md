* Show/All: Retrieve an object from a file
* Operations: Do operations on objects (ex. count instances)
* Update: Update attributes of an object
* Destroy: Destroy an object

## Environment
This project is interpreted/tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.10.12)

## Installation

## Description
 This team project is part of alx  Software Engineer program. It's the first step towards building a first full web application: an AirBnB clone.
 This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data management,and the base classes for the storage of this data.

## Console and Command Usage
The console is a Unix shell-like command line user interface provided by the python CmdModule It prints a prompt and waits for the user for input, for our project we used (hbnb)

| Command | Example   |
| ------- | --------- |
|Display commands help| (hbnb) help <command>             
|Create object (prints its id)	      | (hbnb) create <class>) or (<class>).create()|
|Destroy object	                      | (hbnb) destroy <class> <id> or (hbnb) <class>.destroy(<id>)                  |
|Show object                          | (hbnb) show <class> <id> or (hbnb) <class>.show(<id>)                        |
|Show "all" objects or instances class|	(hbnb) all or (hbnb) all <class> or <class>.all()                                             |
|Run console	                      | ./console.py                                                                 |
